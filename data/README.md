### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The dataset comes from the Kaggle link below. We use the Kaggle "train" set as our main dataset before the train/test split. It is renamed "policy_data":
